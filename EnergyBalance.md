## Description ##

  * solves the energy balance for each hillslope dividing it in altimetric and energetic bands
  * contains a sophisticated snow module with which it is possible to calculate the SWE for all the basins
  * evaluation of the contribution to the discharge from the glaciers  during summer time in term of net precipitation (P + SM - SA)
  * results are presented in term of average in watershed

## Example usage ##

An example usage of the algorithm can be found in the testcases suite: [EnergyBalance](http://code.google.com/p/jgrasstools/source/browse/hortonmachine/src/test/java/org/jgrasstools/hortonmachine/models/hm/TestEnergyBalance.java)
