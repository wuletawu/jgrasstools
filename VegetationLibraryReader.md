This utility is used to read the vegetation library file in input to the PenmanEtp module.

Vegetation library has to be written considering for each vegetation type a row, and the attributes in a row are:

  * vegetation id
  * architectural\_resistance
  * min\_stomatal\_resistance
  * LAI (January - December)
  * albedo (January - December)
  * vegetation roughness (January - December)
  * zero plane displacement height (January - December)
  * wind height
  * rgl
  * radiation attenuation by vegetation
  * wind attenuation by vegetation
  * trunk ratio for the vegetation type
