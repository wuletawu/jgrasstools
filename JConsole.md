## JConsole preview ##

The following is a preview on the JConsole, which will be the GUI for the JGrasstools until it is not time to get core algorithms and console back into JGrass. Before we release the JConsole project, we want to have a jgrasstools release and also get the geoscript groovy project working in it as the default scripting language for non-simulation/model-linking purposes.

The JConsole is a standalone console application that is able to execute OMS3 models and link them together, as well as execute groovy code.


## Command completion and colored syntax ##
It has a nice colored syntax for the code and also supports command completion:

## Customizable processes ##
Every script is executed in a different process, and the execution memory for every process can be customized:

## Shortcuts ##
The editor supports many of the keyboard shortcuts that are part of an IDE, making scripting more comfortable:

## Multiprocessing ##
Multiple processes can be run concurrently and stopped at any time:
