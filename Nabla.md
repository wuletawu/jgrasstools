## Description ##
It can work in two ways:
  1. estimate the Laplace operator (with a finite difference scheme).
  1. subdivide the sites in three categories: planar, concave and convex (in according with the Laplace operator).


## Example usage ##

An example usage of the algorithm can be found in the testcases suite: [Nabla](http://code.google.com/p/jgrasstools/source/browse/hortonmachine/src/test/java/org/jgrasstools/hortonmachine/models/hm/TestNabla.java)
